            this blog I want to highlight Key benefits of AI to the
            organizations & customers.

            companies to sell the products which are pertinent to the purchase
            customers is making, thanks to all the data analytics machine
            learning algorithm which helps in right recommendation of add-on

            E-Commerce customer satisfaction to the next level & is increasingly
            valuable to the organizations for processes from sales to order
            delivery. AI powered chatbots are able to understand user queries
            through natural language processing (NLP) and can give right
            answers. This is great addition over normal chatbot.

            using data analytics & proposing sales items based on the
            pre-defined criteria. Simple example is facial recognition of
            customers & data driven analytics to offer discounts which are
